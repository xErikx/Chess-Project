# Chess-Project
A simple PvP chess, where users make registration in client, and afterwards begin a game in command line.
All the rules are included except for castling.
In chess I'm using socket programming, SMTP/POP3/IMAP protocols, Sha256 hashing algorythm, AES encryption, Python OOP, Sqlite3 as DB and JSON
